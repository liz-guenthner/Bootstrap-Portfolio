              <p>Hello world, my name is Liz. I was born and raised in Austin, Texas and I don't plan on leaving anytime soon. I paint, landscape and build things in inter-cyber-net-land. I currently work as a Software Developer for an advertising agency in Austin. It's fun and I can bring my dog work so yea, things are pretty great these days. Oh and by the way, this picture of Simon and me is about 5 years old and my hair is completely grey now. Which, now that I think about it, is the <strong>exact</strong> amount of time I've been a developer...hm, interesting. Oh, and one more thing...don't even think about sliding this screen to see if these pages are responsive. I'm whipping out some bootstrap magic on the next round so, sit tight! Cheers...</p>
